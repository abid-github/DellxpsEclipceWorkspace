 * Imagine you have a special keyboard with the following keys: 
Key 1:  Prints 'A' on screen
Key 2: (Ctrl-A): Select screen
Key 3: (Ctrl-C): Copy selection to buffer
Key 4: (Ctrl-V): Print buffer on screen appending it
                 after what has already been printed. 

If you can only press the keyboard for N times (with the above four
keys), write a program to produce maximum numbers of A's. That is to
say, the input parameter is N (No. of keys that you can press), the 
output is M (No. of As that you can produce).
