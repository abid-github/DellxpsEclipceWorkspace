/**
 * Time Complexity - worst O(nlogn) Best-O(nlogn).
 * Like QuickSort, Merge Sort is a Divide and Conquer algorithm. 
 * It divides the input array into two halves, calls itself for the two 
 * halves, and then merges the two sorted halves. The merge() function is 
 * used for merging two halves. The merge(arr, l, m, r) is a key process 
 * that assumes that arr[l..m] and arr[m+1..r] are sorted and merges the 
 * two sorted sub-arrays into one. 
 * See the following C implementation for details.
